**Shilahama 白濱旅遊攻略**


**Transportation**

- Take JR(recommend 黑潮號)
- 關西JR周遊券

To get Shirahama, I highly recommend you the **關西5/7日周遊券**, which can help you to take the 黑潮號 (the FAST JR can get to Shirahama), and as it shows in the name, 關西周遊券 conclude all your trip-fees as long as you take the JR railway in KANSAI part (including 大阪，京都，奈良，神戶 etc.）. You can get it on TAOBAO(淘寶) or buy it at the KANSAI airport and exchange it at the KANSAI airport (see details at TAOBAO).

- In Shirahama, you can use cash to take the Meko bus or buy the one-day pass bus ticket (not really nessary)

**Attention**: 黑潮號 only provide signed seats. Please make sure you have selected your seats on the ticket machine.
